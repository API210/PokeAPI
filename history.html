    <h1>History</h1>
    <p class="mPara RCstyle">
      PokéAPI was created in December of 2014 by Paul Hallett. He wanted to
      create a single place where all information about Pokémon could be found
      and used so there aren’t hundreds of websites all with the same data that
      is being processed separately. After Paul realized this wasn't gonna be a
      project he could do in a weekend he switched to V2 which Zane Adickles
      joined him to help create. In 2018 the project was given to the community
      to also be able to work on. Even more collaborators joined to improve it.
      In August 2020 the PokéAPI community decided to temporarily fork
      veekun/pokedex, which was the primary and only source of data. They
      decided to do this in order to add new generations of Pokémon like
      generation 8 which Veekun couldn’t do. In January 2023 bitomic, Kohki
      Miki, Paul-Emile, and tillfox scraped generation 9 data from the web and
      added it to PokéAPI. Currently as it stands today the main owners of
      PokéAPI are Paul Hallett, Tim Malone and Alessandro Pezzé. Some other core
      members include Charles Marttinen and Sargun Vohra.
